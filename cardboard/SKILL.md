  Edit Cardboard video projects (.cardboard bundles) with the `cb` CLI and timeline.tsx: cut, arrange, caption, add
  titles and motion graphics, generate footage, narration, music or sound effects, import video links, and check the
  result with cb look. Use when a task mentions Cardboard or `cb`, or a .cardboard folder or timeline.tsx is in view.

# Cardboard

A Cardboard project is a folder, `<Name>.cardboard/`, whose **`timeline.tsx`** is a literal TSX mirror of the timeline
that Cardboard regenerates on every save. Edit it and save, and the project changes; an open app follows within ~200 ms
as one undo step.

`cb` (alias of `cardboard`) is on PATH once the app's **File › Install Agent Tools…** has run, or via `pnpm cli` in the
repo. Commands that work on a project take its **name, id or bundle path**, and every command accepts `--json`.
`cb docs <topic>` prints command documentation; the same files sit in `commands/` next to this skill. For
[synced captions](techniques/synced-captions.md) or
[behind-subject compositing](techniques/behind-subject-compositing.md), follow the matching technique.

## The loop

1. `cb project list`, then `cb source print <project>` (or open `timeline.tsx`). Read the header: aspect, duration, the
   **media table** (names to use as `src`), the cast, `diagnostics`, and `// cardboard:rev <n>`.
2. **Place before you fill.** Add every new element with its `name`, `start`, `end` and track, and `pending` in place of
   the content (`codeComposition` on `<code>`, `src` on `<clip>`/`<image>`/`<audio>`). Save. Pending elements show as
   labelled shimmering blocks, render as nothing in `look`, and block export, so the human sees the shape of the edit
   while you work. Even a single `<code>` graphic goes in this way.
3. **Fill.** Re-read the file, which now gives each placeholder an `id`. Keep the `id`, drop `pending`, add the content,
   save. One element per save.
4. App open: saving applies and toasts. App closed: `cb source apply <project>`. `cb source check <project> file.tsx`
   dry-runs a file.
5. Read back: the header lists `diagnostics` (what was rejected and why) and how many items are still `pending`; leave
   none. Then `cb verify <project>` and `cb look <project> --at <s>`.
6. Wrong turn? `cb history <project>` and `cb undo <project> [rev]`.

Items without an `id` are new and items you delete from the file are removed. Items you keep carry their `id`: leave it
as it is, since a changed `id` replaces the item and loses the human's undo trail. Only what you touched changes, so the
human's edits to other items survive.

`timeline.tsx` is parsed, never evaluated, so attribute values are literals: no variables, calls or spreads. For loops
and helpers, write a `.tsx` script and run `cb source apply <project> gen.tsx --eval`. Never write `project.json`.

```tsx
<track kind="video" name="Titles">
  <code name="Lower third" start={0.5} end={4} pending />
</track>
<track kind="video" name="B-roll">
  <clip name="Skyline" start={4} end={9} pending />
</track>
```

## Elements

```tsx
export default (
  <timeline aspect="16:9">
    <track kind="video" name="Titles">
      <text start={0.5} end={3} textContent="Hello" fontSize={72} color="#ffffff" />
    </track>
    <track kind="video" name="V1">
      <clip src="interview.mp4" start={0} end={12.5} in={3} out={15.5} />
      <image src="logo.png" start={0} end={3} transform={{ x: 640, y: -360, scale: 0.3, rotation: 0 }} />
    </track>
    <track kind="audio" name="A1">
      <audio src="music.mp3" start={0} end={12.5} volume={40} audioFadeOut={{ duration: 1 }} />
    </track>
  </timeline>
);
```

- The **first track is the top layer** for every element kind, `<code>` included. To put an image over a graphic, list
  the image's track first.
- `start`/`end` are timeline seconds; `in`/`out` are source seconds. `src` is a name from the header, a media id, or a
  path, which is ingested on apply.
- `<code>` is a JSX motion graphic: one pure function of `{ time, width, height, assets }`, linted on apply. Read
  `cb docs code` before writing one. Name every graphic after what it shows.
- `cb docs source` has the element and attribute table; `timeline.d.ts` beside the file has the typings.

## Seeing

You cannot watch the video; look at frames and numbers instead.

Times given to `media *` and `audio *` are **source** seconds; times given to `look`, `seek` and items are **timeline**
seconds.

## Hearing

You cannot listen either; read the transcript and the levels.

## New footage, voice and sound

Read `cb docs generate` before the first run; models, lengths, credits, prompting and casting live there.

- `cb generate video <project> "<prompt>" --start <s>` places a pending clip and fills it when the model returns.
  `--quality standard` for b-roll and anything you might redo, `best` for the shot that carries the video.
- `cb generate image <project> "<prompt>" --start <s>` places a still the same way; `--quality best` for lettering and
  fine detail, `--image <media|path>` to redraw an image you have.
- Both come out in the project's aspect, or the closest the model renders; `--aspect` sets another frame.
- A multi-scene story under 30 seconds, from nothing: one `--model wan-3.0 --duration 30` run with every scene listed in
  order.
- A person who recurs across clips is a cast member: `@Name` in the prompt, plus `--character "Name: look"` on first
  use. Cast everyone who recurs, kids included.
- `cb generate voice <project> "<text>" --voice <id|name> --start <s>` places narration with its transcript; see
  `cb docs voice`.
- `cb generate music <project> "<style>" --auto` composes a music bed for the whole timeline on a `Music` track, with
  sections planned from cached speech and visible titles; `--dry-run` first to see the sections.
  `cb generate sfx <project> "<sound>" --start <s>` places one sound effect on an `SFX` track. Both are in
  `cb docs generate`.
- `cb media add <project> "<link>"` imports a YouTube, X or Instagram video ready to cut; see `cb docs download`. The
  human is responsible for what they have the right to use.

Projects live in the signed-in account's library, so `cb` needs the sign-in the desktop app shares. Exit 3 means nobody
is signed in (`cb auth login`), or, for commands that need the app, that it is not running or the project has no tab.
Exit 4 means out of credits; the human tops up in Settings › Usage. Other failures say what to fix.

## The app

`cb app context|open|seek|play|pause`, `cb screenshot <out.png>` and `cb export <project> <out.mp4>` talk to the running
app. "Cardboard is not running" is a normal answer: editing, `verify`, `media *` and `audio *` work on the bundle alone,
while `look` and `export` need the app unless `cb` runs from a source checkout. Do not launch the app yourself. Pass the
project to every `app` command and `screenshot`, so you act on your tab and not the one the human is looking at. A
project with no tab gets one from `cb app open <project>`, behind the tab in front; every command works there, and
playback in it is silent. The human decides which tab is in front: add `--focus` only when they ask to see the project.

An export encodes the whole video for minutes into a file you cannot watch either, and the human already sees the edit
in the app. Export when they ask for the video file, or when the task itself needs one (a file to upload, attach or hand
to another tool).

## Habits

- Small edits, then `verify` and `look`; that is how an edit is checked. Do not rewrite a timeline you were asked to
  trim.
- `cb audio transcribe` returns word timings the editor, captions and search all share from one cached transcript, and
  `cb generate` places its footage and speech on the timeline itself. A local speech model, or media made with another
  tool and `media add`ed, has none of that, so use these.
- Report changes in terms of items, briefly: "moved the title to 0.5-3s, trimmed clip 2 by 1.2s". Leave out the
  commands, scripts and file paths behind them unless the human asked for a file or has to act on one.
